   <h2>Giraffes</h2>
   
     <p> My favorite animal is a giraffe. A giraffe is a genus of African mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. They mostly live in Africa and warm regions. There are many different types of giraffes for example a West African giraffe, Rothschild's giraffe, and many more. The average height for a adult male giraffe is 16-20ft, and adult female is 15ft. They are herbivores. Lastly, giraffes also have two small, straight horns on the top of their heads and a tongue which can be up to 20 inches in length.
